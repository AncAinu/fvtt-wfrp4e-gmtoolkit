# GM Toolkit (WFRP 4e)

Utility module with tweaks, enhancements and macros to help GMs manage games of [Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (4e)](https://github.com/moo-man/WFRP4e-FoundryVTT) in [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/). 

## Compatibility

Version 0.7.0 requires
- Foundry VTT: 0.8.8+
- WFRP4e: 4.0.6+

If you are using earlier versions of WFRP4e (3.4.1 - 3.6.2) and Foundry (0.7.10), then you should use [v0.6.3](https://github.com/Jagusti/fvtt-wfrp4e-gmtoolkit/releases/tag/v0.6.3) of the GM Toolkit.

## Installation Instructions
For full details, see the [Getting Started guide](../../wiki/getting-started) on the [wiki](../../wiki).

1. Add via Add-on Modules tab of Foundry VTT setup.
   - Module Name: `GM Toolkit (WFRP4e)`
   - Manifest URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jagusti/fvtt-wfrp4e-gmtoolkit/master/module.json
2. The GM needs to enable the module for the World:
   - `Settings` > `Manage Modules` > `GM Toolkit (WFRP 4e)`
3. [Import macros](https://github.com/Jagusti/fvtt-wfrp4e-gmtoolkit/wiki/getting-started#macros) to your Macro Directory via `Compendiums` > `Macro` > `GM Toolkit`.
   - Any imported macros will appear in the Macro Directory, next to the Macro Hotbar.
   - Open the Macro Directory and drag required macros onto a free space on the Marco Hotbar. 
4. Revised macros will *not automatically* replace your existing GM Toolkit macros. You will need to manually re-import them from the Macro Compendium into your Macro Directory to take advantage of the improvements.
