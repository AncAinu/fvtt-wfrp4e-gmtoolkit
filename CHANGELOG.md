## Unreleased
See [Issue Backlog](../../issues) and [Roadmap](../../milestones). 

- *Added* French translations for enhancements and changes to Version 0.5.1 (thanks to @LeRatierBretonnien).
- *Removed* dependency on external Furnace module. Macros should be re-imported from the macro compendium to take advantage. Thanks to Forien for support with this. 
- *Changed* macro code to improve notification and string handling. 
- *Added* explicit dependency on WFRP4e system, as supported by Foundry 0.6.6.
- *Added* option to toggle token hud extensions. Hud extensions are enabled by default. This update also makes the token hud extension available to non-GMs, and each user can enable or disable it independently. 
- *Added* module settings for the GM to
  - define token vision distances for normal and Dark Vision in dim or night conditions. 
  - allow Night or Dark Vision even if token does not have the relevant talent or trait. 
- *Fixed* Night Vision to work with characters with the Trait, and not just characters with the Talent.
- *Changed* No Vision setting to also clear light emission from token.
- *Added* Soulfire (Magic Miscast) to light source options. 
- *Fixed* Storm Lantern lighting options. 
  - Broadbeam is treated as unshuttered and providing 360Â° illumination.
  - Shuttered eliminates light emission.
- *Added* dynamic update to token hud when Advantage is increased, reduced or cleared. Any changes are visible immediately in the token hud resource bar if the token hud is active. This applies when using the relevant advantage macros as well as when starting or ending combat, depending on the Clear Advantage setting. 
- *Added* dynamic update to Token Hud Extension when using shortcuts to increment or decrement Resolve, Resilience, Fortune, Fate, Sin or Corruption. Any changes are visible immediately in the token hud resource bar if the token hud is active.
